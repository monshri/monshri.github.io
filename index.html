<p>
   I am Shriti Priya, a current Master's Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. 
   My personality is framed by the experiences and learnings that I gained from meeting different people.
   One thing that has remain constant in my life, apart from love towards my parents is my love for Science and Technology. Working with 
   bright minds at CMU, Qualcomm for 2 years etc, has provided me with language to serve my passion.
   </p>

<p>
   I have two passions in life:
 <ul>
  <li>Capture beauties of all dimensions.</li> 
  <li>Analyse it.</li>
</ul>
   </p>

   What I do with my captures?
   1. My analysis comes in the form of Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Computer Vision : <a href="https://github.com/monshri"> </a>
   2. Or my Poetry : <a href="http://shritipriya.blogspot.com/"> </a>
      
   </p>  
   And when I am doing all this, I meditate!
