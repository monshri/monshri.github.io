   I am Shriti Priya, current Master's Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. 
   My personality is framed by the experiences and learnings that I gained from meeting different people.
   One thing that has remain constant in my life is love for Science and Technology. Working with 
   bright minds at CMU, Qualcomm for 2 years etc, has helped this model generalise better :P.

<p>
   I have two passions in life:
 <ul>
  <li>Capture beauties of all dimensions. I have string proclivity towards Nature! </li> 
  <li>Analyse it.</li>
</ul>
   </p>

   <h1>What I do with my captures?</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>My analysis comes in the form of Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Computer Vision <a href="https://github.com/monshri"> </a></li> 
  <li>Or my Poetry <a href="https://shritipriya.blogspot.com/"> </a></li>
